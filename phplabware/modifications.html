<h3>Change log for PhpLabware</h3>
<h4>Version 0.6</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Made editview mode use XMLHTTPRequest calls rather than a popunder window.  Improves performance considerably</li>
   <li>Finally changed to using superglobal (_POST, etc..) instead of old style globals</li>
   <li>Long text fields are now displayed with javascript tooltips (Michael Muller)</li>
   <li>Replaced some buttons with icons (Michael Muller)</li>
   <li>Fixed bug not dealing with quotes</li>
   <li>Fixed bug not sorting on pulldown fields</li>
   <li>Made editing of table structures much more comfortable using Ajax stuff</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 0.5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reworked data import module.  Now should add all unknown values to mpulldown fields too.</li>
<li>Fixed problem with reports that caused shorter columnnames to be used instead of longer ones (when the first part of the two matched).</li>
<li>Started a second permissions chain for users allowing more properties to be set without affecting access rights.  This was needed for URL-based logins (allowing even quicker deep linking).</li>
<li>Made much (most/all?) generated HTML w3c compliant, also looks better in IE.</li>
<li>Editing table values in edit mode is now much faster: Pages are not reloaded anymore after each change, using javascript a new window is opened through which the changes are send to the server.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with access controls changing when working in edit mode.</li>
<li>Made data import accessible to normal users.</li>
<li>PDFs plugin: now download pdf reprint articles from many major publisher directly (only input needed id the PMID).</li>
<li>Fixed a potentially disastrous bug popping up when deleting a column of type file</li>
<li>Made it possible to execute a search based solely on GET variables. Therefore, you can now link directly to a subset of records in phplabware.</li>
</ul> 
<h4>Version 0.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added views, giving users the ability to decide which columns to see in table view and in record view</li>
<li>Added database constructs.</li>
<li>Added database ordering.</li>
<li>Added Styles (thanks to Dieter for 'Scottish', and 'Sparta').</li>
<li>Improved inport data wizzard.</li>
<li>Added option to output reports to file.</li>
<li>Many bug fixes, check (again) to work on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.3</h4>
<ul>
 <li>'Modify' now takes place in a separate window (when the browser supports javascript).  This takes some kinks outof the UI flow.</li>
 <li>Started documentation (folder). First entry details report template file structure.</li>
 <li>Improved data export and import</li>
 <li>Added possibility to search on data linked through datatype table</li>
 <li>Added postgres maintenance (Vaccuum analyze) to postgres databases</li>
 <li>Moved access rights from a string-based approach (rw-rw-rw) to a boolean column based approach which should be faster in the long run</li>
 <li>Added mpulldowns, a pulldown menu in which multiple items can be selected.  For now, you can only search for one of these items</li>
 <li>Updated dumptable, dumpcontent, import data and made menu entries for these scripts</li>
 <li>Added standard xml reports</li>
 <li>Added sysadmin defineable reports</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.2</h4>
<ul>
 <li>When searching on pulldowns, passing the value -1 will search for fields with No value.</li>
 <li>Improved handling of datatype table, making it feasable to link between data in different databases.</li>
 <li>Added script dumpcontent.php that will extract table content to a tab-delimited file.</li>
 <li>Datatype date can now be freely used, changed table datatypes (version 0.1006).</li>
 <li>Improved import script, now also handles quoted variables.</li>
 <li>Allow 'complicated' searches on number fields (i.e., 1-5,7,9).</li>
 <li>Datatype image makes thumbnails of images.</li>
 <li>Added datatypes user, date, int, float, sequence, image, and table.</li>
 <li>Opens View page in a separate window.</li>
 <li>Makes indices of text, doc and pdf files, allowing for full-text searches in files.</li>
</ul>
